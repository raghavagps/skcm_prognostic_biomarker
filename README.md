# üß¨ Identification of Multiple Prognostic Biomarkers sets for Risk stratification in SKCM

This project identifies and validates prognostic biomarker sets in
**skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM)** using statistical and machine
learning approaches.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîç Overview

-   **Data Retrieval**: Gene expression data (473 samples, 60,660 genes)
    was downloaded from TCGA using `TCGAbiolinks` in R.
-   **Normalization**: Data was normalized to TPM.
-   **Statistical Analysis**: Performed correlation analysis, survival
    analysis (Cox, Kaplan-Meier), and LASSO.
-   **Survival Class Creation**: OS time was used to create 4 survival
    classes (0--1, 1--3, 3--5, \>5 years ‚Üí Class 0,1,2,3).
-   **Feature Selection**: Applied SVC-L1, RFE, SelectKBest, and SFS to
    identify top genes.
-   **Class Balancing**: Used SMOTE to balance the dataset.
-   **Biomarker Sets**: Created 7 biomarker sets (each with 20 genes).
-   **Model Performance**: AUC ranged from **0.84 to 0.91**, and Kappa
    from **0.48 to 0.64** across sets.
-   **Model Training**: Applied many models but best Trained classifiers
    (CatBoost) and evaluated using AUC-ROC.
-   **Validation**: Validated on **GSE65904 (214 samples)** using
    overlapping genes.
    -   **First Set**: 15 matching genes ‚Üí AUC 0.85 (train), 0.83
        (test)
    -   **Third Set**: 12 matching genes ‚Üí AUC 0.85 (train), 0.86 (test)
